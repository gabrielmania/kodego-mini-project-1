With this in his mind, he tried to think of a way in order to lessen or eliminate the problems his clients are encountering when purchasing their property. He came up with an idea to establish a “one-stop” website that will cater to all the needs of his clients. Thus in 2008, Our Home was created as a brainchild of Mr. dela Cruz. It was tough going at first but as internet connectivity increase in the country, so thus the people discovering Our Home to provide them with the best customer service and experience.
